# FeatureEngineering-BiLSTM
This repository contains stock datasets of Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT). Data is segmented into "Raw" datasets (with basic OHLCV features) and "Enhanced" datasets (with additional technical/engineered features). It also includes the source code of our BiLSTM model and its alternative for comparative purposes.
