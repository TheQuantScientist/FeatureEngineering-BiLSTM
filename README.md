# FeatureEngineering-BiLSTM
This repository contains stock datasets of Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT). Data is segmented into "Raw" datasets (with basic OHLCV features) and "Enhanced" datasets (with additional technical/engineered features). It also includes the source code of our BiLSTM model and its alternative for comparative purposes.

**Note:** Due to linkage relationship in submitted papers, the repo name could not be changed as it would affect embedded URLs. Nevertheless, **FeatureEngineering-BiLSTM** should be the correct name of the current updated source.
